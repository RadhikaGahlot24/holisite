              <div class="common2 a2"><p class="para">Holi, the Festival of Colors, is a vibrant and joyous Hindu festival primarily celebrated in India and Nepal, marking the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil. It usually takes place in March, on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna. The festival is rooted in several myths, notably the story of Prahlad and the demon king Hiranyakashipu, symbolizing the victory of devotion and righteousness. Holi is most famous for the playful throwing of colored powders and water, a tradition that spreads joy and unity among people of all ages and backgrounds. The celebrations also include bonfires known as Holika Dahan, symbolizing the burning of evil, and the preparation of special foods like gujiya and thandai. </p></div>

              <div class="more b1"><p class="para">The most iconic tradition is the playful throwing of brightly colored powders (gulal) at friends, family, and even strangers, filling the air with vivid hues. This joyful activity takes place in streets, parks, and open spaces, with people laughing and dancing together. The night before Holi, people gather around bonfires in a ritual known as Holika Dahan, symbolizing the destruction of evil, commemorating the mythological story of Holika and Prahlad. Music, dance, and traditional songs (Holi Geet) are also an integral part of the celebration, creating a festive atmosphere. Special foods like gujiya (sweet pastries) and thandai (a milk-based drink) are enjoyed, adding to the indulgence of the festival. Holi is also a time for visiting friends and family, strengthening social bonds and spreading joy.</p></div>
